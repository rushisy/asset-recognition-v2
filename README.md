# asset-recognition-project

## train asset recognition program


- import raw data from bnsf
- identify all different assets (update with full list)
- geo-locate assets via forward facing camera mounted perpendicular to track at the top of the train
- create digital twins in conjunction with gps tracking to view exact location of train at any given time
- replicate feature similar to GTA 5 where cops have viewing radius if wanted level increases, same idea just with trains on tracks (ex below)

## ASAP TODOS

- add all dependencies and package versions to readme file
- get list of all assets that need to be detected
- find pictures of all assets
- install picture labeling software (labellmg)
- upload testing footage to the "data/workspace/images/test" folder (or find alternative by using google drive link? -> make public)

## NOTES
